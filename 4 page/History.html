							“There is a stereotype that Kazakh cuisine, in particular beshbarmak and baursaks, is unhealthy. It is also believed that the Kazakhs in cooking are limited to products from meat and flour. We will prove the opposite and declare to the whole world that all our dishes are healthy and nutritious. After all, our ancestors did not suffer from complex diseases and did not suffer from obesity. The correct use of food is another matter. For example, after meat dishes, you need to drink fermented milk products. Water, grain products, meat are at the genetic level of the nation, and dishes made from them have a beneficial effect on the body, ”says the researcher.

								“Each dish has its own period. For example, the dish that was prepared in the stomach of cattle goes back to the nomadic period. There are special dishes for men, women, children, guests, daughters-in-law, son-in-law, and so on. In general, this ceremony is called "tabat tartu", we count 40 of them. This suggests that farms paid tribute to everyone. For example, one of the rituals "white hello" is to meet a guest with a white drink, thus wishing him a bright future. Guests who came from afar were presented with okpe days: milk was poured into the lungs of a ram through the larynx and boiled. This dish turns out to be very tender, which speaks of the attitude towards guests. Children were pampered with telshik kuyrdak, its preparation is not laborious, but has its own characteristics. The fact is that even in winter, meat from a horse's rib was placed in flour and left until spring. And for Nauryz, meat was taken out of flour, finely chopped, stewed. The flour in which it was found is also suitable, it is impregnated and becomes yellow. The dough is made from it. The last dish is called ozben taylak, ”says the interlocutor.
